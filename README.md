## Getting Started

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `src/main/index.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

Install Node Package Manager (NVM): 

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

Install Node 8.11.1: 

```bash
nvm install 8.11.1
```

If you get `nvm: command not found`, simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try again. Please see the [NVM readme](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if you have any issues.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperbridge/blockhub-desktop-client
# This are dev dependencies (linked for ease of development)
git clone git@github.com:hyperbridge/token.git
git clone git@github.com:hyperbridge/marketplace-protocol.git
git clone git@github.com:hyperbridge/funding-protocol.git
# Go into them and npm install
cd token && npm install && cd ..
cd marketplace-protocol && npm install && cd ..
cd funding-protocol && npm install && cd ..
# Go into the main repo
cd blockhub-desktop-client
# Link the deps
npm link ../token ../marketplace-protocol ../funding-protocol
# Install deps
npm install
# Run the app in electron
npm run dev
# Create the desktop app
npm run package
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
